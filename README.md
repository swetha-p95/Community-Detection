We perform community detection on various datasets with known ground-truth communities using different algorithms and evaluate the performance of these algorithms using the metrics modularity, normalized mutual information, variation of information, and adjusted Rand index.
All datasets have been obtained from: https://github.com/vlivashkin/community-graphs
